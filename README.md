# Website Cookie Understanding and Consent

The purpose of this project is to gain an understanding of website users’ understanding and consent of cookies. There are four main types of cookies on websites: strictly necessary cookies, performance cookies, functional cookies, and targeting cookies, and many websites give users the option to customize which of these cookies to accept and which to reject. This project consists of two main components: research, to understand what data is collected by each of the four cookie types, and a survey, to understand from website users what their understanding of these types of cookies is and which cookie types they accept and reject. It was initially predicted that users do not fully understand each type of cookie and therefore may be consenting to data collection they would not approve of otherwise. The enabling of misunderstood cookies and disabling of understood cookies by survey respondents suggested a negative correlation between understanding and consent of cookies that supports the initial prediction.

## Introduction

All popularly used websites utilize cookies to help collect user data and include pop-ups notifying the user of this. However, while users have the option to accept all cookies, reject all but necessary cookies, or choose only certain cookies to accept, many people have an unclear understanding of what these cookies are and what data is collected. The research question that guides this project is “How does a website’s collection of data through cookies compare to a user’s understanding and consent?” It was initially expected that users do not fully understand what cookies mean and therefore may be consenting to data collection they would not approve of otherwise.

### Types of Cookies
There are four main types of cookies that websites use to collect user data: strictly necessary cookies, performance cookies, functional cookies, and targeting cookies. These cookies collect different user data in order to perform different functions. The following is a breakdown of each type of cookie:

•	Strictly Necessary Cookies: This is the only type of cookie that cannot be rejected by the user and is the only type that does not require user consent for websites to use. This type of cookie allows for basic functionality of websites, such as loading images, logging in, and saving items in a cart. [1]

•	Performance Cookies: This type of cookie allows website creators to understand how users interact with the website, such as which pages they visit and which links they click on, in order to update and improve the functionality of their websites as needed. [1]

•	Functional Cookies: This type of cookie allows websites to remember user preferences or choices on the site, such as login information and language, in order to provide personalized features and enhance a user’s continued experience on the website. [1]

•	Targeting Cookies: This type of cookie allows for advertisers to provide personalized advertisements to users based on interests, heavily viewed topics, and behaviors. [1]

## Data Collection of Cookies

In order to ultimately compare what data website users believe is collected by each type of cookie, it is necessary to gain further understanding of data collection performed by each type of cookie. To accomplish this, research was conducted on each type. The following is a breakdown of what data is collected by each type of cookie:

•	Strictly Necessary Cookies: This type of cookie mostly consists of first-party cookies, meaning they are stored and accessed only by the website and its domain. Cookies of this type collect data related to what actions users perform on pages so that a user’s progress on previous pages carries over to other pages they navigate to. An example of this is collecting data on what items a user adds to their shopping cart so that the items are present when they navigate to their cart. [2]

•	Performance Cookies: This type of cookie collects anonymous data related to a user’s interaction with a website, including how many times they visit a website, what links on a web page they click on, and if they receive error messages. [2]

•	Functional Cookies: This type of cookie collects anonymous data related to a user’s preferences on a website, including usernames, passwords, chosen language, and location. [2]

•	Targeting Cookies: This type of cookie mostly consists of third-party cookies, meaning they are stored externally from the website and its domain and can be accessed by any website using the external server. Cookies of this type collect data related to websites a user visits, items a user views when on a website, what items a user purchases on a website, and other behaviors of a user, which in turn allows advertisers to determine a user’s personal interests. [2]

## Survey

A survey [3] was created in order to learn from website users what types of cookies they consent to and what data they believe is collected from the different types of cookies.

Although survey respondents overall reported concern regarding data collection and protecting their online data, the most common actions towards cookies are to ignore/close pop-ups and not read a website’s cookie/privacy policy. A few respondents explained their reasoning behind these decisions. Respondents who had a neutral view on data collection and privacy protection also reported an indifference towards data collection through cookies. Respondents who felt more concern towards data collection and privacy protection felt that ignoring or closing cookie pop-ups was a quick way for them to reject cookie data collection. However, the validity of this belief depends on whether a website uses an explicit or implicit cookie consent model.

An explicit cookie consent model is a model in which users must actively consent to the use of cookies. In this type of model, the user has to click to accept the collection of data through cookies, so ignoring or closing cookie pop-ups is a valid way of rejecting cookie data collection. This cookie consent model is required by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a law that applies to any website that offers goods or services in the European Union [1]. Therefore, on global and widely used websites, ignoring or closing pop-ups ensures cookies are not used.

An implicit cookie model, on the other hand, is a model in which users do not need to actively accept the use of cookies. By entering and using a website with this model, consent regarding the use of cookies is implied. Therefore, ignoring or closing pop-ups is not a valid way of rejecting cookie data collection.

The most misunderstood cookie types according to the survey results are functional and performance cookies. Out of the three types of cookies that can be disabled, these are also the two types that are disabled the least even by respondents who felt concern towards data collection and privacy protection. Respondents’ explanations as to why they do not disable these cookies include uncertainty regarding what these cookies do and unfamiliarity with a “Manage Preferences” option on cookie pop-ups. The other type of cookie that can be disabled, targeting cookies, are the most understood type of cookie by the survey respondents and were also disabled the most. These findings suggest a negative correlation between understanding and consent of cookies, which supports the initial prediction that users do not fully understand what cookies mean and therefore may be consenting to data collection they would not approve of otherwise.
